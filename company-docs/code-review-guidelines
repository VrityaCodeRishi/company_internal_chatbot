AgentForce Infotech Code Review Guidelines

All code changes must go through peer review before merging to main branch. Follow these guidelines:

1. Merge Request (MR) Requirements:
   - Descriptive title: "PROJ-123: Add user authentication feature"
   - Detailed description explaining what and why
   - Link to related Jira ticket (format: PROJ-123)
   - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
   - Update relevant documentation (README, API docs)
   - Self-review checklist completed

2. Code Review Checklist:
   - Code follows AgentForce style guide:
     * Frontend: ESLint config (extends Airbnb style guide)
     * Backend: Black formatter, Pylint (score > 8.0)
   - No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets
   - Environment variables used for config
   - Proper error handling and logging (use our logger, not print statements)
   - Tests included for new features (unit + integration)
   - No console.log, print(), or debug statements
   - Database migrations included if schema changes
   - API versioning followed if backend changes

3. Review Process:
   - Request review from at least one team member
   - For critical changes, request review from Tech Lead (Vikram Singh)
   - Address ALL review comments before merging
   - Resolve merge conflicts before requesting re-review
   - Get approval from code owner for shared modules

4. Review Etiquette:
   - Be constructive, respectful, and professional
   - Explain WHY changes are needed, not just what
   - Suggest alternatives when possible
   - Approve promptly if code looks good (within 24 hours)
   - Use GitLab MR comments for discussions

5. Merge Rules:
   - Squash commits before merging (use "Squash and merge" option)
   - Delete feature branch after merge (GitLab auto-deletes)
   - Update Jira ticket status to "Done"
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes before merging

6. Special Cases:
   - Security-related changes: Require review from Security team (contact security@agentforce.com)
   - Database migrations: Require review from DBA (contact database@agentforce.com)
   - Infrastructure changes: Require review from DevOps (Anjali Mehta)
