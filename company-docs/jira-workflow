AgentForce Infotech Jira Workflow and Ticket Management

## Ticket Types

**Epic**: Large feature or initiative (e.g., "User Authentication System")
**Story**: User-facing feature (e.g., "As a user, I want to login with OAuth")
**Task**: Technical work item (e.g., "Setup Redis caching layer")
**Bug**: Defect or issue (e.g., "Login button not working on mobile")
**Subtask**: Part of a larger ticket
**Incident**: Production issues (P0/P1 severity)

## Workflow States

1. **Backlog**: Not yet prioritized (Product Owner manages)
2. **To Do**: Ready to work on (assigned to sprint)
3. **In Progress**: Currently being worked on (update daily)
4. **Code Review**: Merge Request created, awaiting review
5. **QA**: Ready for testing (assign to QA team)
6. **Testing**: QA is testing (QA team updates)
7. **Done**: Completed and verified (moved by QA or Product Owner)

## Creating Tickets

Required fields:
- Clear, descriptive title (format: "PROJ-123: Brief description")
- Detailed description (what, why, how)
- Acceptance criteria (bullet points)
- Story points (for stories/epics, use Fibonacci)
- Assignee and reporter
- Labels: `backend`, `frontend`, `api`, `ui`, `bug`, etc.
- Components: `Phoenix`, `Atlas`, `Hercules` (project names)
- Fix Version: Target release version

## Best Practices

- Update ticket status regularly (daily updates expected)
- Add comments for progress updates (what you did, what you're doing)
- Link related tickets (use "relates to" or "blocks")
- Attach screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
- Reference GitLab commit hashes in comments
- Move to "Done" only after QA verification and Product Owner approval
- Use time tracking (log hours worked daily)

## Sprint Planning

- Sprint duration: 2 weeks
- Planning meeting: Monday 10:00 AM IST (every 2 weeks)
- Retrospective: Friday 3:00 PM IST (end of sprint)
- Story points: Use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Sprint capacity: Typically 20-30 story points per developer per sprint

## Estimation Guidelines

- 1 point: 2-4 hours (simple bug fix, small change)
- 2 points: Half day (4-8 hours)
- 3 points: Full day (1 day)
- 5 points: 2 days (moderate complexity)
- 8 points: 3-4 days (complex feature, break down if possible)
- 13+ points: Break down into smaller tickets (epic)

## Reporting and Tracking

- Update time logs daily (helps with velocity tracking)
- Use Jira dashboards for progress tracking:
  - Sprint Burndown Chart
  - Velocity Chart
  - Cumulative Flow Diagram
- Burndown charts available in sprint view
- Velocity tracked automatically (average story points per sprint)

## Jira Projects

- **PHOENIX**: Phoenix project (main product)
- **ATLAS**: Atlas project (new initiative)
- **HERCULES**: Hercules project (internal tools)
- **INCIDENT**: Production incidents (P0/P1)
- **ADMIN**: Admin tasks and infrastructure
