## Best Practices

1. **Be on time**: Join 2 minutes early (IST timezone)
2. **Have an agenda**: Share beforehand in calendar invite or Slack
3. **Stay focused**: No multitasking (close other applications)
4. **Take notes**: Document action items (use shared doc or Confluence)
5. **Follow up**: Send summary with action items after meeting (within 1 hour)

## Video Call Etiquette (Google Meet)

- Use camera when possible (especially for client-facing meetings)
- Mute when not speaking (reduce background noise)
- Use good lighting and professional background (or blur)
- Test audio/video before meeting starts
- Use chat for questions during presentations (don't interrupt)
- Share screen only when needed (close sensitive tabs/windows)

## Meeting Room Booking

- Book rooms through Outlook calendar (Conference Room A, B, C, D)
- Include Google Meet link for remote participants (always)
- Cancel if meeting is no longer needed (free up room)
- Don't book rooms you won't use (check availability first)
- Room capacity: A (20), B (10), C (6), D (4 people)

## No-Meeting Days / Focus Time

- **Wednesday**: Focus time (no meetings 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM IST)
- **Friday afternoon**: Minimal meetings after 2:00 PM IST
- Block your calendar for focus time if needed
- Use "Do Not Disturb" status in Slack during focus time

## Declining Meetings

It's okay to decline if:
- You're not needed for the discussion (politely decline with reason)
- Meeting conflicts with focus time (suggest async alternative)
- You can contribute asynchronously (suggest async communication)
- Suggest alternative time if urgent (be helpful)

## Meeting Tools

- **Calendar**: Outlook (Microsoft 365)
- **Video Calls**: Google Meet (primary), Zoom (backup)
- **Documentation**: Confluence (meeting notes)
- **Action Items**: Jira (link to tickets)

## Meeting Follow-ups
