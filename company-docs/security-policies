AgentForce Infotech Security Policies and Best Practices

## Password Requirements

- Minimum 12 characters (enforced by Active Directory)
- Must include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- Cannot reuse last 8 passwords
- Must change every 90 days (system enforces)
- Use AgentForce 1Password Business (company-managed vault)
- Never share passwords via email or Slack

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA is mandatory for:
- FortiClient VPN access (required for remote work)
- Production systems (AWS, Kubernetes, GitLab)
- Admin accounts (any role with elevated permissions)
- Financial systems (SAP, payroll systems)
- Database access (production)

Set up 2FA:
1. Go to: https://auth.agentforce.com/2fa
2. Use Microsoft Authenticator app (preferred) or Google Authenticator
3. Contact IT helpdesk if you need backup codes

## Data Handling

- Never store passwords, API keys, or secrets in code
- Use environment variables or HashiCorp Vault (for production secrets)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (AES-256)
- Use HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- Follow GDPR and Indian data protection guidelines for user data
- Customer PII must be encrypted in database

## Access Control

- Request minimum required access (principle of least privilege)
- Access reviews conducted quarterly by Security team
- Report suspicious activity immediately to security@agentforce.com
- Don't share credentials, tokens, or access keys
- Use service accounts for automated processes (not personal accounts)
- All access requests must be approved by manager

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately change your password and enable 2FA if not already
2. Report to security@agentforce.com (24/7 monitored)
3. Contact security team in #agentforce-security-alerts Slack channel
4. Do NOT attempt to investigate yourself
5. Preserve evidence (screenshots, logs) if safe to do so

Security team contacts:
- Security Lead: Neha Kapoor (neha.kapoor@agentforce.com, ext 4001)

## Code Security

- Run security scans before deployment (SonarQube, OWASP dependency check)
- Keep dependencies updated (check monthly via Dependabot alerts)
- Review third-party library security (check CVE database)
- Use parameterized queries for database (prevent SQL injection)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Never commit secrets to GitLab (use .gitignore, scan with git-secrets)
- Use secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10 awareness)

## Security Training

- Complete annual security awareness course (mandatory)
- Training portal: https://training.agentforce.com/security
- New employees must complete within first month
