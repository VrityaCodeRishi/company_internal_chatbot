## Best Practices

1. Use threads for replies to keep channels organized (especially in busy channels)
2. Use @channel sparingly (only for urgent, company-wide matters)
3. Use @here for messages relevant to currently online team members
4. Don't DM for questions that could help others (use public channels for knowledge sharing)
5. Set your status when away, in meetings, or on vacation
6. Use status emoji: 🍕 (lunch), 🏥 (sick), 🏖️ (vacation), 🔕 (focus time)

## Response Times (IST - Indian Standard Time)

- Urgent (@here/@channel): Within 1 hour during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM IST)
- Normal messages: Within 4 business hours
- Non-urgent: Within 24 hours
- Weekend/after hours: Next business day (unless marked urgent)

## Etiquette

- Be respectful, professional, and inclusive
- Use emojis appropriately (👍 for acknowledgment, ✅ for done, ❌ for issues)
- Don't send messages outside business hours (9 AM - 6 PM IST) unless urgent
- Use code blocks (```) for code snippets
- Tag relevant people when asking questions (@username)
- Use "Do Not Disturb" mode during focus time or meetings

## Status Updates

Update your Slack status for:
- Out of office (OOO)
- In meetings (with meeting name if helpful)
- Focus time / Do Not Disturb
- On vacation (with dates)
- Working from home (WFH)

## Channel Naming Convention

All channels follow: `agentforce-{team/project/topic}` format
- Team channels: agentforce-{team-name}
- Project channels: agentforce-{project-name}
- Topic channels: agentforce-{topic}
